/// ## Basic usage
///
/// ```dart
/// final result = await CNAlert.show<String>(
///   context: context,
///   title: 'Delete photo?',
///   message: 'This cannot be undone.',
///   actions: const [
///     CNAlertAction(label: 'Cancel', isCancel: true),
///     CNAlertAction(label: 'Delete', value: 'delete', isDestructive: true),
///   ],
/// );
///
/// if (result?.value == 'delete') _deletePhoto();
/// ```
///
/// ## With a text field
///
/// ```dart
/// final result = await CNAlert.show<String>(
///   context: context,
///   title: 'Rename',
///   textFields: const [
///     CNAlertTextField(placeholder: 'Name', initialText: 'Untitled'),
///   ],
///   actions: const [
///     CNAlertAction(label: 'Cancel', isCancel: true),
///     CNAlertAction(label: 'Save', value: 'save', isDefault: true),
///   ],
/// );
///
/// if (result?.value == 'save') rename(result!.textFields.first);
/// ```
///
/// ## What this deliberately does not do
///
/// - **No custom content.** `UIAlertController` has no public API for an
///   arbitrary content view; the properties that would allow it
///   (`contentViewController`, `_headerContentViewController`) are private.
/// - **No icons on actions.** `UIAlertAction` has no public image property.
/// - **No severity.** `UIAlertController.severity` is Mac Catalyst only.
/// - **No anchoring.** An alert is always centred; anchoring to a source view
///   is an action-sheet behaviour.

  /// without a button press, or — on iOS only — a second [CNAlert.show]
  /// superseded this one, taking its alert down and resolving this call to
  /// null. The Flutter fallback stacks instead: the earlier dialog stays up and
  /// resolves on its own button press. A pressed button — including a cancel
