///
/// `UIAlertAction` exposes no public image property, so an icon field here
/// could never render on the native path. The `setValue(_:forKey: "image")`

/// On iOS this presents a real `UIAlertController` in
/// `UIAlertController.Style.actionSheet`, so the sheet is the system control:
/// system destructive red, the detached cancel row, VoiceOver, Dynamic Type,
/// and — on iOS 26 — the Liquid Glass appearance, which the system applies with
/// no opt-in. Because the appearance comes from the OS, the native path is used
/// on every supported iOS version rather than being gated on iOS 26.
///
/// On every other platform the sheet falls back to a [CupertinoActionSheet]
/// presented through [CNBottomSheet.showModalPopup], which keeps the geometry
/// probe the package relies on to hide platform views behind modals.
///
/// ## Basic usage
///
/// ```dart
/// final choice = await CNActionSheet.show<String>(
///   context: context,
///   title: 'Delete photo?',
///   message: 'This cannot be undone.',
///   actions: const [
///     CNActionSheetAction(
///       label: 'Delete',
///       value: 'delete',
///       isDestructive: true,
///     ),
///     CNActionSheetAction(label: 'Duplicate', value: 'duplicate'),
///   ],
///   cancelLabel: 'Cancel',
/// );
///
/// if (choice == 'delete') _deletePhoto();
/// ```
///
/// ## Anchoring
///
/// Starting in iOS 26 an action sheet anchors to the view it came from on
/// iPhone as well as iPad, appearing directly over that view. Pass
/// [anchorRect] — the global rect of the widget that triggered the sheet — to
/// get that presentation and its transition. Omitting it is still valid: the
/// system centres the sheet and shows a cancel button.
///
/// ```dart
/// final box = _buttonKey.currentContext!.findRenderObject()! as RenderBox;
/// final rect = box.localToGlobal(Offset.zero) & box.size;
///
/// await CNActionSheet.show<String>(
///   context: context,
///   anchorRect: rect,
///   actions: const [CNActionSheetAction(label: 'Share', value: 'share')],
/// );
/// ```
class CNActionSheet {
  CNActionSheet._();

  /// Presents the action sheet and resolves to the selected action's
  /// [CNActionSheetAction.value].
  ///
  /// Resolves to null when the sheet is cancelled, dismissed by tapping
  /// outside, or when the selected action carries no value.
  ///
  /// [title] and [message] are the sheet's header. [cancelLabel] adds a
  /// cancel-styled button; pass null to omit it — though on iOS the system adds
  /// its own cancel button when no [anchorRect] is given.
  ///
  /// Apple's Human Interface Guidelines recommend at most four buttons
  /// including cancel. Longer lists work, but scroll.
