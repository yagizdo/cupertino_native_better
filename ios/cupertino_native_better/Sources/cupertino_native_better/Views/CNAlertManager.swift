/// view hierarchy. That also means it is unaffected by the iOS hybrid
/// composition bleed that forces `ModalHideMixin` to tear down inline CN
/// widgets behind Flutter-drawn modals — this alert is real UIKit, above
/// everything.
///
/// Liquid Glass is deliberately absent from this file. On iOS 26 the system
/// applies the new appearance to alerts with no opt-in, so the correct amount
/// of glass code is none.
///
/// No anchoring either. WWDC25 session 284 changed *action sheet* presentation
/// on iOS 26 — a sheet now anchors to its source view on iPhone as well as
/// iPad. An alert is always centred, so there is no `sourceView` to set and
/// `popoverPresentationController` is never touched.
///
/// Modelled on `CNNativeTabBarManager`: a singleton owning its own method
/// channel, wired up from `CupertinoNativePlugin.register`.
